<h1>Server-Side Web Scripting</h1>

<ul>Java Servlets</ul>
<ul>
    <ul>-Java objects that are intended to play the role of server components in client-server communications</ul>
    <ul>-handles client requests by generating responses to such requests</ul>
    <ul>-part of the Java EE specification (see Java Servlet API for more details)</ul>
    <ul>-hosted in a ‘servlet container’ that provides the environment in which the servlet runs as well as controls the ‘servlet lifecycle’…</ul>
</ul>

<ul>*servlet lifecycle</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
    <li>Instantiation</li>
    <ul>=> constructor call…</ul>
    <ul>-creates an instance of the servlet to service client requests…</ul>
    <ul>-invoked implicitly by the servlet container when the servlet is called upon to service a client request and no instance</ul>
    <li>Initialization</li>
    <ul>=> init () method …</ul>
    <ul>-invoked only once and is intended for any startup initialization code</ul>
    <li>Request Handling</li>
    <ul>=> service () method …</ul>
    <ul>-invoked for each logic necessary in order client request</ul>
    <ul>-multiple client requests are typically handled</ul>
    <li>Destruction</li>
    <ul>=> destroy () method …</ul>
    <ul>-invoked before the servlet instance is ‘unloaded’, and is intended for any ‘housekeeping’ code that the servlet may need to run…</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>HTTP Servlet</ul>
<ul>
    <ul>-Java server used to handle HTTP requests and generate HTTP responses…</ul>
    <ul>-hosted in a ‘web container’, which is a component in a Java ‘application server’ (e.g. Apache Tomcat, RedHat JBoss/WildFly, Oracle GlassFish, IBM WebSphere, etc.)</ul>
    <ul>-the service() method call is routed to a doXXX() call, depending on the HTTP request method, e.g. doGet(), doPost(), doHead(), doPut(), doDelete()</ul>
    <ul>-the doXXX() methods are passed two argumentation:</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul><li>HTTP Servlet Request</li></ul>
<ul>
    <ul>-object representation of the HTTP request sent by the client and receive by the Servlet</ul>
    <ul>-access information from the request message (e.g. HTTP request method, request URI, query string, message headers, message payload)</ul>
</ul>

<ul><li>HTTP Servlet Response</li></ul>
<ul>
    <ul>-object representation of the HTTP response generated by the servlet and sent back to the requesting client</ul>
    <ul>-used to set information in the response message (e.g. HTTP response status codes, message headers, message payload)</ul>
</ul>    
</ul>

<ul>*the web container facilitates the conversion to and from the HTTP request/response message to HTTP Servlet Request/ HTTP Servlet Response</ul>
